            <p>
                Simply put, process piping is used to convert liquids, chemicals, fuels, gases or other raw materials into a usable product. Pipes directing water through an industrial factory to cool processes wouldn’t be considered process piping, but if the piping moves the water into processes to be converted into cleaning chemicals, soft drinks, or combined with other materials to make an end product, they would then be process piping.

                So, technically, process piping is any pipes and components that are not part of the building’s mechanical systems. Pipe systems for liquids and gases used for heating and cooling processes, or pipework that leads to plumbing fixtures or waste-water systems, would not be considered process piping systems. Instead, these are considered part of plumbing systems. Process piping is also not used for power processing systems.

                Process piping can consist of interconnected piping systems such as tubing, pipes, pressure hoses, valves, separators, traps, flanges, fittings, gaskets, strainers and other components. These piping components can be placed together to move, mix, separate, stop, distribute or control the flow of fluids. Process piping is commonly used in the semiconductor, chemical, paper processing, petroleum refinery, pharmaceutical and textile industries
                </br>
                Process equipment manufacturers provide process piping solutions to OEM manufacturers that need to mix, distribute, and control liquids and gases throughout production operations. Axenics’ engineers can help you design process piping components that can be used in present operations when space is an issue. We are expert at manufacturing components that require materials manufactured to specifications using high purity welding, bending and cutting methods. When OEM manufacturers simply don’t have the space or the required technicians to create the process piping, they turn to Axenics and our capabilities.

                Manufacturers can obtain tubing kits and assemblies to place into larger manufacturing productions when they need to expand operations or introduce new product lines. They can also obtain specialty kits for repair and replacement purposes for their systems.

                When looking for reliable tubing and pipes for your process piping systems, let Axenics provide customizable pipe and tubing manufacturing services. We will ensure your process equipment is up to OEM industry standards and suitable for your specific operations.
