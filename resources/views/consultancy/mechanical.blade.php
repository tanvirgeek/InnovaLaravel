                It won’t be an exaggeration to say that mechanical engineering can be called fundamental in terms of construction’s life cycle. To be more exact, it’s not all about mechanics. Mechanical, electrical and public health engineering often go hand and we never forget about it.

                To make sure every tool or machine works fine and the way it’s meant to do, mechanical consultancy has become an indispensable part of every construction project. Consequently, we offer complete building services for projects of all types. Thinking global is much better, isn’t it?
                Professionalism is above all. Karno Energy’s engineers persistently follow this credo in their work. Our goal is to create long-term partnerships and implement projects of the highest quality. Before every project is put into work, our mechanical engineers introduce the overall layout of all systems and subsystems that fall into the category of mechanical engineering services and explain all possible benefits to the client.

                Let’s take for example mechanical ventilation setup. In addition to accurate aerodynamic calculations, cold and heat loads, our engineers analyze the convenience of equipment installation, its visual layout (which is very important for architects) and prepare a detailed specification of materials.

                We are ready to support our clients at all stages of the project from concept to as-built documentation and to create together the perfect BIM model that will meet the BIM Level2 standards and contain all the necessary information.
                Being competent these days means combining standard mechanical engineering solutions with a creative touch. Our specialists try to follow the trends of implementing BIM digital techs in their working field.

                Do you remember the time of good old blueprints? Well, now about 90 % of all work is performed on computers. Mechanical engineering consultants will be ready to show you the detailed image of any mechanical service you’d like to get.

                We take advantage of the most advanced 3D modelling software available on the market like Revit, Navisworks etc. The powerful duo of technologies and trustworthy specialists will grant every project’s successful finish.
