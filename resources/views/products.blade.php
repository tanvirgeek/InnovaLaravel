                        The units of the Energy series represent the maximum expression of
technical innovation for the treatment of outside air. The Energy series
has been specifically designed to reduce to the minimum the operating energy consumption, which represents around 80% of the entire
life cycle cost of an air treatment unit. The double heat recovery system
(static and active) and the innovative cooling and adiabatic humidification system, allow the supply of air at the desired conditions with the
minimum energy expenditure.

                        <h6>
                        The units from the SPL series represent the ideal solution to guarantee
the comfort conditions in small-medium spaces such as health centres,
spa areas, fitness centres, small swimming pools, sports facilities, etc.
The unit contains a refrigerant circuit and a system for the recovery
of sensible and latent heat coming from the humid air extracted from
the space, thereby being optimised for the reduction of energy consumption. The main function of the unit, which is a "plug and play" machine ready for use, is that of dehumidifying and at the same time ensuring control of the temperature and humidity conditions of the area
served.

                        <h6>Centro-Jet casing is made of polymer coated steel.
Due to low height of the casing the fan is recommended for use
in low-ceilinged room.
The protecting grille on the intake side prevents ingress
of foreign objects into the fan.
Deflector plates on the exhaust side of the fan ensure correct
air flow distribution.</h6>

                        <h6>Axis-Jet casing has a tubular shape and is made of polymer coated
steel. The fan has a sound insulation of mineral wool. The casing
includes inner brackets for motor fixation. These brackets act as
directing vanes and distribute air flow uniformly, thus increasing
aerodynamic performances of the fan. </h6>

DISCAL
546 - 5461 series</h5>
                        <h6>Deaerators-dirt separators are used to continuously eliminate the
air and dirt contained in the hydraulic circuits of heating and
cooling systems. They are capable of automatically removing all
the air present in the system down to micro-bubble level. At the
same time they separate dirt and impurities contained in the water
within the circuit and collect them in the lower part of the valve
body, from which they may be expelled</h6>

MINICAL® – VALCAL®
5020 - 5021 - 5022 series
</h5>
                        <h6>Automatic air vents perform the function of eliminating the air which
builds up inside climate control system circuits without any manual
intervention. This prevents the appearance of negative phenomena
that might prejudice the working life and performance of the heating
system, such as:
- corrosion caused by oxygen;
- localised air pockets in the radiators;
- cavitation in the circulation pumps.</h6>

                        <h6>Balancing valves are hydraulic devices used for accurately regulating
the flow rate of the thermal medium supplying the terminal emitters
of a system.
Correct balancing of the hydraulic circuits is essential to guarantee
system operation according to design specifications, high thermal
comfort and low energy consumption.</h6>

                        <h6>The ball valves with built-in check valve BALLSTOP combine two
devices in a single body: a ball shut-off valve and a check valve
housed inside the ball itself. This dual function allows for quicker
installation and a more compact device, which means less space
required on the pipe.
BALLSTOP valves are available in two versions for two different uses:
the version with black plastic external ring for use in domestic water
systems and the version with red external ring for heating systems.

Moreover, it allows for carrying out the system maintenance and
calibration operations.
It allows the connection of fan coils, cold beams or ceiling conditioning
systems with the main distribution network.
Complete with insulation suitable for both heating and cooling.
Available with Venturi device for flow rate measurement</h6>

                        <h6>The thermostatic mixing valve is used in systems that produce
domestic hot water.
It is designed to maintain the preset temperature of the mixed water
delivered to the user outlet, when there are variations in the
temperature and pressure of the hot and cold water at the inlet, or
in the drawn-off flow rate.
These devices are also available with fittings complete with
strainers and check valves on the hot and cold water inlets.</h6>

with self-contained cartridge</h5>
                        <h6>Pressure reducing valves are devices which, when installed on
private water systems, reduce and stabilise the pressure of the
water entering from the public network. This inlet pressure, in
general, is too high and variable to be applied directly to domestic
systems.
This series of pressure reducing valves have the feature to be preadjustable. The pressure reducing valve can be set to the desired
pressure value before installation, using an adjustment knob with a
pressure setting indicator. After installation, the system pressure
will automatically adjust itself to the set value</h6>
